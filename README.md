Our story began when an unfortunate incident occurred last Friday night. Shababa, one of the co-founder, lost her wallet. The next morning when she met with her team, she told them the story of her missing wallet. While they were discussing a "hack for change", the team thought of problems they all had in their own lives. Turns how Shababa's loss was a blessing in disguise, the team ended up formulating the idea of Gimme. 

Gimme allows people who have lost their belongings to be instantly contacted when someone has found their item. This is achieved by leaving a sticker with a  special Gimme QR code on their item. When the item gets lost and found, the finder can scan the code via Gimme and it opens a chat with the item owner. From there both parties can discuss how to return the item.
